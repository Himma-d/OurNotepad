Contribution
------------
This project is updated based on Ao hou's npp.  Since the original author shares the politicized software in the open source community, as a firm opponent of his point of view, I would rather not join his team in violation of the spirit of the open source community. I only thank the original author for his contribution to the initial version of npp.  Committed to grammar analysis, data processing, and data visualization, I hope ournotepad will grow and serve everyone who follows the spirit of open source.

Code contribution is welcome. Here are some [rules](CONTRIBUTING.md) that your should follow to make your contribution accepted easily.
